Satellite brightness temperatures are available through the ISCCP simulator and could be requested every 15 minutes; this simulator makes the simulation computationally more expensive, so might not be requested for each model simulation, pending further review and advice.

Online training is complete and training was carried out in SWIFT 2019 science meeting, will be repeated in 2020 if desired. Slack chanel being setup for NWCSAF setup trouble shooting. Jennifer can correspond with Leif regarding python-based code for satellite data access.\r\nPut back the deadline for review in month 24. Training using NWCSAF-GEO delivered at Ghana WP training (AR and JG), also South African Weatehr Service session on nowcasting methods (Morne Gjiben)

We had earlier studied high impact weather events but their dates were different from the eventually accepted case studies	"Work has started on various case studies of high impact and/or widespread storms.  A particular high impact event which occurred between 23rd - 28th May 2018 and affected both Nigeria and Ghana, is being focused for detailed analysis.  Data for these are already being downloaded for the critical analysis.  Hoever, accessibility to satellite and radr products has and is a constraint.

These case studies are  from the Civil Protection Department of Senegal and the associated rainfall are validated with  rain gauge data from ANACIM and satellite observation data (TRMM, CHIRPS and CMORPH). A composite analysis is performed in order to characterize the main synoptic features associated with such events.  In parallel, role of some large scale drivers (SST patterns and tropical modes) in the selected case studies events is analysed . 	"ACMAD have supplied a list of cases and institutional leads on the multi-case study paper are reviewing them. 60%. All institutions have cases identified, but list needs compilation, requested before WP34 meeting on 26 Sept 2019.
