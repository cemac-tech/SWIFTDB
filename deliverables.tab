D-R3.1	WP-R3	Establish a new UK research capability in using satellite observations to study the dynamics and physics of convective clouds in the tropics	NCAS-AP	Jennifer Fletcher	2019-10-01		"Staff are in place and progress has been made, especially in nowcasting. One staff post is still to be advertised and filled. Postpone deadline to Oct 2020 to allow for this. 

Deadline extended to month 36 as this is a very large undertaking. 60% complete as of Jan 2020. 40% complete as Jennifer is occupied with other deliverables (including for WP C1) and has not had time for the in-depth work required to establish new expertise in satellite remote sensing of clouds. -JKF\r\n\r\n20% complete. The grade 8 position has been filled; Jennifer Fletcher will start in Nov, 2018. The  other position will be filled in Jan 2019 and then the networking etc  will begin.

D-M1.28	WP-M1	Case study B	ACMAD	Elijah Adefisan	2019-12-01		Case study B investigates the dynamics of a strong and long-lasting African Easterly Wave (AEW) and associated Meso-scale Convective Systems (MCSs) that traverse Nigeria up to Senegal in August 2017. It is observed that the analysis and results cut across all the WPs and being led by Dr. Elijah A. Adefisan. Analysis is on-going	10	At least three papers have been proposed to come from the full analysis and interpretation		2020-01-17
D-R7.2	WP-R7	Creation of a set of CP ensemble forecasts over tropical Africa and prototype post-processed products for research and training. For use by Africa-SWIFT academics and African partners. The forecast data will be available on the Met Office MASS archive for UK academics and will be packaged up appropriately to send to partners as needed. Post-processed products will be provided for the testbeds and other training activities.	UKMO	Stu Webster	2020-12-01		CP ensembles are almost completely run and have been archived on MASS for use by the academic community.	70			2020-01-22
D-R3.3	WP-R3	Make satellite products available to African centres	NCAS-AP	Jennifer Fletcher	2019-08-01		"Jan 2020: this needs to be delayed as there are many bureaucratic obstacles to obtaining dishes, however KNUST do have a dish and are setting it up. 6 Nov 2019: 60% complete (dishes are on their way and NCAS are assisting university and operational centres in setting up systems. 5 March 2019: a dish has been installed at Chilbolton and James Groves can access data and run it through the NWCSAF software. No change on the installation/knowledge sharing with African parters -- this will take place during Testbed 1b  (April/May 2019) and Summer School (July 2019). This will be very complex given the number of partners who are all at different stages in their current access to the data and software. -JKF\r\n\r\nJune 2019: NWCSAF products are available on the web and systems developed to get them directly.\r\nEnabling access to METEOSAT channels has been slower then expected and will take longer.\r\nAt the Science Meeting we need to establish what people need, in order to do the SWIFT science - case studies and statistics. Not necessarily Meteosat, maybe TRMM.\r\nPlease postpone deadline to M30.\r\n\r\n30% complete approximately. Difificult to determine since the task is so involved. The plan is to get the EUMETSAT products working in UoL on a local compute. Then take disks, or laptops with everything set up and working to the African partners and teach them how to use the products. A satellite dish and decoder will have to be bought by the African parnters for streaming the EUMETSAT data in real time.

NWC-SAF producst are available to African centres, since April 2019. Raw data products can be received by those with a dish (and 4 have been shipped to the university partners) but this is still ongoing work."	60			2020-02-12

The analysis was done for MAM and OND rainfall seasons. A draft paper based on the analysis is being prepared.
