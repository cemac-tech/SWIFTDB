WP-M1	Project Management	Fellowships cohort 2 is being recruited to - good news on number of applications and number of female applications. Cohort 1 fellows have provided mid-term reports, these are due to be evaluated by each fellows' management committee in January - outputs from these reviews will integrate findings and the work of the fellows into the SWIFT programme more fully and impacts communicated outside of the programme. Secondments are currently being advertised - call closes end Jan 2020. Annual reporting is in draft and AB meetings set-up to ensure AB & Project officer reporting is submitted on-time and with reflection on SWIFT activities. LY will pass on draft reporting documents to her maternity cover before leaving, so that this can be completed in the NY. Science Meeting 2019 and Summer School was a success. Report on this to be circulated to the EC before LY goes on maternity leave.	Fellowships cohort 2 is being recruited to - good news on number of applications and number of female applications.

LY will be on maternity leave from mid-December 2019; her cover will begin in the role in january 2020 - short period of adjustment and other personnel changes in the PO are ongoing. Better alignment of the WPs in terms of science is needed - hopefully the case study development and working will facilitate this. 	Financial management plans and strategies needed from all partners; decision on Science Meeting 2020 (where and when); all meetings in calendars to end of 2021; case study development; refinement and prioritisation of project communications with the recruitment of a new Events and Comms Officer; LogFrame and ToC changes.	2019-12-01

WP-R1	Users and Communication	In September a paper based on our first deliverable was accepted for publication in Environmental Research Letters. A policy brief on the Ghana (Accra) workshop has been produced and disseminated. The policy brief for the Senegal workshop has been completed and is in the process of being translated into French. The policy brief for Nigeria is in preparation. A paper reporting on our workshop activities related to exploring the potential for impact based warnings forecasts in West Africa is being prepared for submission to a special issue of Frontiers in Climate Risk Management (paper led by Elias Nkiaka).   Data collection for national surveys is currently in progress in partner countries (T-R1.2.5a to T T-R1.2.5d), with this being coordinated by Victor Savatia (ACMAD). Funding to support this activity has been disbursed to partner institutions in Kenya, Senegal and Nigeria. The disbursement to GMet is in the process of being resolved. Deliverable R1.2 “A report on user perceptions and needs for forecast products for different timescales and sectors in each country”, which will report on survey findings, along with the workshops, is scheduled for completion in Feb 2020.

WP-R6	S2S Forecasting	"This work package can broadly be divided into three categories: (i) improving our understanding of the drivers of sub-seasonal variability over Africa; (ii) Evaluation (including skill) of sub-seasonal prediction systems; (iii) S2S Forecast testbed, and work is progressing in each of these. Across the (i) and (ii) there are plans for 10-15 papers which are in various stages (mostly early) of development. Some work is being developed within analysis of case studies which can cut across the WP, e.g. an analysis of the differneces in the 2018 and 2019 MAM rains over Africa. i)	Drivers of sub-seasonal variability  Work is progressing on analysing the role of the MJO on rainfall for most regions in particular its relationship to Monsoon Onset in West Africa. Based on AEW tracking developed in WP5 we will also explore the sub-seasonal drivers of AEW variability. Work has begun more generally on Monsoon Onset in West African Partners. A more broad review of existing knowledge of sub-seasonal drivers is underway, although this hasn't advanced much over the last 3 months. ii)	Sub-seasonal forecast skill The S2S database has been used to assess forecast skill for weekly rainfall over the whole of Africa, including some preliminary assessment of skill conditioned on MJO phase, and papers are in preparation on skill for Monthly rainfall and weekly rainfall at up to 1 month lead time. iii) Work in the last 3 months has focussed on preparation for the S2S testbed, with a successful kick off meeting in Ngong in November. The workshop developed plans for the 2 year testbed, to be fully defined by partners in conjunction with selected forecast users over the next month.

Over the next months there is still a need to ensure that each person working on the WP has a clearly defined programme  of work, with tangilble outputs contributing to the WP deliverables.	None due, although we expect to submit a number of papers contributing to D-R6.1 and D-R6.2 (and will form the basis on a benchmarking of forecast skill for D-R6.3) during the coming months as well as benchmarking for current operational practice for D-R6.5	2019-12-01
WP-C1	Training	Progress has been good. We now need to develop a very clear programme of work to deliver the training tools demanded by partners. D-C1.1: The skills matrix has been completed by significant numbers of people: the data need to be analysed (Elijah: ACMAD). D-C1.2: The comparison of syllabuses and curriculum needs has been completed and is being written up for a paper (Elijah). Major conclusions are: Need for computational methods training, particularly python and R (and fortran), in universities and in weather services. Need for synoptic methods training, especially in universities. Includes development of case-study practicals. There is also a request for: NWP and modelling training: how to set up and run models, mainly in the weather centres. Nowcasting skills (both operational and universities). D-C1.3: Secondments call has been advertised.  D-C1.10: > 20 applications for the second call for fellowships (> 50% female).	Progress has been good.

We have budget for 2 science meetings and 1 more training event. Also partner budgets can be used for this (overheads, conferences and events budgets). Plan in-country collaborative events? E.g. UoN people will attend training at KMD.  Consider partnerships in training (e.g. EAMAC, WMO Global Campus (WMO-GC), SWFDP, EUMETSAT, …)  Select new set of fellows, and secondments.

WP-R7	Convection-Permitting Ensemble Forecasting	Suitable dates for the bulk of CP ensemble simulations have been identified (T-R7.2.1). Some additional case studies may be added as they occur. Test cases have been run and an initial evaluation performed by Sam Clarke (T-R7.2.2). A final test case was recently completed and checked for complete requested diagnostics by Beth Woodhams. As a result, final model runs are underway (Stu Webster, T-R7.2.3, D-R7.2). Beth has been in contact with CEMAC who are helping to design a streamlined data download and file conversion from PP to netCDF (~1 month work).  For testbed 1b, some ensemble forecast products were produced (T-R7.2.4) but these will be added to and improved during the evaluation process and in anticipation of testbed 3. Carlo Cafaro has begun work on evaluation of CP ensembles vs. global ensembles (T-R7.3.1) as part of an ensembles introduction paper covering the testbed 1b period. Carlo and Beth have a meeting scheduled in December to talk further about the paper. Beth will likely be contributing a particular case study to the analysis.  The benchmarking report on current operational convection-permitting ensembles (D-R7.1 and T-R7.1.1) will be finalised by Beth by mid-December. D-R7.3 and D-R7.4 are on track but require model simulations to be completed.	Suitable dates for the bulk of CP ensemble simulations have been identified (T-R7.2.1).

It has been estimated that ~50 Tb of space will be needed to store the case study data on JASMIN (although this could be greatly reduced following conversion from raw PP to netCDF files. Given the storage space required by nowcasting (following discussions with Alex Roberts), we may need to consider increasing the size of the SWIFT workspace on JASMIN at some point.

WP-R2	Forecast Evaluation	The WP has seen a lot of change this year, aligning tasks and deliverables with people's ongoing activities. This has led to a greater involvement of forecast verification practice with the operational forecasting partners (GMet, ANACIM, KMD, and NiMet) and regular reports on forecast skill are now presented. The second major activity has been the selection and development of case studies during the science meeting in Kumasi, Ghana. Each case study has leadership assigned as of November and potential paper publications and collaborations are being developed. WP-R2 is very much a collaborative WP with other WPs and some publications planned are listed elsewhere. Nevertheless, papers are in preparation with planned submission for peer review in the next 3 months, particularly on evaluation of CP ensembles and nowcasting systems.
