The report has been shared with WP-R7 and Met Office partners for further consideration of additional diagnostics. Conclusions are that the OLR diagnostic should be provided instantaneous and at 15 minute intervals. Satellite brightness temperatures are available through the ISCCP simulator and could be requested every 15 minutes; this simulator makes the simulation computationally more expensive, so might not be requested for each model simulation, pending further review and advice. Both diagnostics will allow a like-with-like evaluation against satellite measurements that are used for storm characteristics and nowcasting in WP-R3/4.

GCRF African SWIFT Work Package R6- Sub-seasonal to Seasonal (S2S)
COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVES OF OPERATIONAL FORECASTING AND RESEARCH ON THE MAJOR DRIVERS OF WEATHER OVER EAST AND WEST AFRICA
Compiled by the UON SWIFT Team: Mutemi, J. N, Gitau, W., Bosire, E. N. and B. Mutai
1.0	Introduction
A spontaneous survey of both forecasters’ and researchers’ perspectives on the major drivers of weather over the both East and West African regions was carried out. Among participants sampled during the testbed 1B meeting in Nairobi from 23rd April to 6th May 2019, were two from Uganda, five from Kenya, two from Tanzania, one form Niger, three from Nigeria, one from Senegal, one from Ghana, and three from the UK. 
The two questions posed were: 
1.	What are the major drivers of weather in your area?
2.	What are some of the research questions you can pose to address (1) above?
2.0	Survey Perspectives
The output of the survey over East and West Africa are presented in sections 2.1 and 2.2, respectively with subsections on the drivers and research questions. In the last section (2.3), a UK perspective on the East and African weather is presented. 
2.1	East Africa Region
2.1.1	Major drivers of weather in East Africa
Several systems ranging from local to global scale which interact in a complex way influence weather over East Africa region were cited. These could be grouped into three: Planetary/global, Synoptic and Mesoscale. The planetary scale systems include the global teleconnections which impact on weather regimes. These include:  
a)	El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), 
b)	Dipole modes like the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), 
c)	Quasi Biannual Oscillation (QBO), 
d)	Intra-seasonal Oscillations such as Madden-Julian Oscillations (MJO), 
e)	Jet streams, 
f)	Monsoons and the monsoonal transitional attributes, 
g)	Easterly Waves,
h)	The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ),
On a synoptic scale, the following systems were cited:
a)	Sub-tropical anticyclones and associated thermo-dynamical forcing on East Africa weather (Mascarene, St Helena, Arabian and Azores)
b)	Tropical cyclones over South-Western Indian Ocean
c)	Congo airmass
On a mesoscale, the following systems were cited;
a)	Lake Victoria mesoscale and L. Victoria trough
b)	Land and sea breeze
c)	Mountain-valley circulations
d)	Urban-rural effects

2.1.2	Research Questions
Over East Africa, the following research questions were stated regarding the influence of the drivers cited in section 2.1.1 above on weather over the Eastern Africa region:
1.	What is the role and influence of the ITCZ on the Eastern Africa weather?
2.	What is needed to identify the thermodynamic attributes of ITCZ in E. Africa (Zonal-arm, meridional arm, vertical profiles, etc). What would be the lead time of these attributes for more accurate intra-seasonal weather prediction in East Africa.
3.	What is the role of the Madden Julian Oscillation in the intra-seasonal variability of East Africa?
4.	What is the influence of tropical cyclones in Eastern Africa weather?
5.	What are the impacts of the subtropical anticyclones to the weather of East Africa?
6.	What is the impact of the Congo airmass to the regional weather? 
7.	Dose the convection permitting ensembles increase or improve forecasting of sever weather storms in hot spot areas of E. Africa, for example over  L. Victoria basin and adjacent highlands?
8.	What are the effects of the following on the weather over the Eastern Africa region?
a.	Intra-seasonal systems such as  MJO
b.	Easterly waves

COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVES OF OPERATIONAL FORECASTING AND RESEARCH ON THE MAJOR DRIVERS OF WEATHER OVER EAST AND WEST AFRICA
Compiled by the UON SWIFT Team: Mutemi, J. N, Gitau, W., Bosire, E. N. and B. Mutai
1.0	Introduction
A spontaneous survey of both forecasters’ and researchers’ perspectives on the major drivers of weather over the both East and West African regions was carried out. Among participants sampled during the testbed 1B meeting in Nairobi from 23rd April to 6th May 2019, were two from Uganda, five from Kenya, two from Tanzania, one form Niger, three from Nigeria, one from Senegal, one from Ghana, and three from the UK. 
The two questions posed were: 
1.	What are the major drivers of weather in your area?
2.	What are some of the research questions you can pose to address (1) above?
2.0	Survey Perspectives
The output of the survey over East and West Africa are presented in sections 2.1 and 2.2, respectively with subsections on the drivers and research questions. In the last section (2.3), a UK perspective on the East and African weather is presented. 
2.1	East Africa Region
2.1.1	Major drivers of weather in East Africa
Several systems ranging from local to global scale which interact in a complex way influence weather over East Africa region were cited. These could be grouped into three: Planetary/global, Synoptic and Mesoscale. The planetary scale systems include the global teleconnections which impact on weather regimes. These include:  
a)	El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), 
b)	Dipole modes like the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), 
c)	Quasi Biannual Oscillation (QBO), 
d)	Intra-seasonal Oscillations such as Madden-Julian Oscillations (MJO), 
e)	Jet streams, 
f)	Monsoons and the monsoonal transitional attributes, 
g)	Easterly Waves,
h)	The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ),
On a synoptic scale, the following systems were cited:
a)	Sub-tropical anticyclones and associated thermo-dynamical forcing on East Africa weather (Mascarene, St Helena, Arabian and Azores)
b)	Tropical cyclones over South-Western Indian Ocean
c)	Congo airmass
On a mesoscale, the following systems were cited;
a)	Lake Victoria mesoscale and L. Victoria trough
b)	Land and sea breeze
c)	Mountain-valley circulations
d)	Urban-rural effects

2.1.2	Research Questions
Over East Africa, the following research questions were stated regarding the influence of the drivers cited in section 2.1.1 above on weather over the Eastern Africa region:
1.	What is the role and influence of the ITCZ on the Eastern Africa weather?
2.	What is needed to identify the thermodynamic attributes of ITCZ in E. Africa (Zonal-arm, meridional arm, vertical profiles, etc). What would be the lead time of these attributes for more accurate intra-seasonal weather prediction in East Africa.
3.	What is the role of the Madden Julian Oscillation in the intra-seasonal variability of East Africa?
4.	What is the influence of tropical cyclones in Eastern Africa weather?

2020-02-25	T-R3.6.2	Alex Roberts	We are a long way from doing this. Have met with Hamish Carr twice. No concrete plans to design a new project yet as we are still mainly focused on existing product (NWC SAF). Need to push the deadline back 12 months to M34, or delete altogether (AB) and focus on improving existing product. Zhiqiang investigating NWCSAF code for precip and with Ralph wil do for RDT and CI. Dialogue started with NWCSAF development team.  AR Involved with ongoing work with UK Met Office and School of Computing and School of Engineering investigating use of Convolutional Neural Networks for forward prediction of Satellite imagery. AR Investigating current Sat data processing and possible image processing methods that can be used for feature identification (priority on reduced latency). NOTE AB 11/11/19. Having gained experience of the needs of African partners, their challenges, and of the NWCSAF products, the view is that emphasis should be placed on improving the existing products (Change T-R3.6.2) and using them extensively. Furthermore, we did not fully appreciate when writing these tasks the challenges of getting the current system up and running in the African institutes and using the products for analysing case studies. We therefore propose that TASKS TR3.6.3 to T-R3.7.7 be deleted. The emphasis will be on T-R3.5.1 to T-R3.5.7 -- i.e. the case studies with the *existing* NWC SAF products.	10	NCAS-paper
