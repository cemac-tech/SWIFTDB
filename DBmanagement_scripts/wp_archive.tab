2018-02-13	WP-R7	One convection-permitting ensemble test case has been completed and evaluated. It is clear that a time-lagged ensemble of deterministic forecasts will provide more spread than full ensemble simulations from a couple of start times. Going forward we will develop a strategy for how to best combine the two. The HyVic research flights over Lake Victoria were successfully completed at the end of January 2019. Some convection-permitting forecasts were run in real-time for this field campaign and testbed1a. These runs successfully forecast dry conditions over the lake and these runs are currently being evaluated against the aircraft observations. We have recently discussed the modelling plan going forward and have agreed to run another set of test ensemble simulations for testbed1b, and then make the final decision about model configuration and ensemble type immediately after that, running the bulk of the past case studies as convection-permitting ensembles between June and December 2019. The main analysis of those runs will be completed in 2020 and 2021.	D-R7.1 has been a little delayed, due to the late start of the WP-R7 PDRA. Beth Woodhams will start in April 2019 and will complete the literature review immediately. 	No deliverables are due in the next quarter.
2019-02-28	WP-R5	(Juliane & Joseph –Updated by Joseph 22FEB2019) Actual science work started during 2018 with tasks T5.1, T5.2, T5.5, and T5.8. Task 5.1 has contributed to two deliverables D5.1 and D5.2 due during reporting period 1. D5.1 has been compiled to more than 50%. It requires few inputs from GMet and ANACIM to become 100%. Its current form is good of comments. Task 5.1 is also contributed to D5.2. D5.2 is a more comprehensive project document and is has been well coordinated and written under leadership of NiMet.  Task 5.2 on identification of case studies for use in both East and West Africa was completed. These cases identified as implied in the issues of advancing the science of operational weather forecasting in Africa building up on the baselines contained in D5.1 and D5.2. Tasks 5.4, 5.5 and 5.8 are the content of current science work in both East and West Africa  and will proceed to the end of SWIFT. Some of the weather data sets, tools and models being used in the research include operational reanalysis (mainly ERAI & NCAR-NCEP), models and weather data post-processing capabilities and forecast models in the “SYNERGY” tool. Following task 5.4, D.3 will be completed during the reporting period 4.	To ensure D5.1 has valid facts from the SWIFT Africa National Meteorological Services (NMSs), Gmet and ANACIM have been requested to provide few statements on human resources and simple map to show the country network of meteorological stations as basis upon which SWIFT will be starting from when addressing operational and research weather data in East and West Africa.	D5.3 during reporting period 4 (i.e. month 24)
2019-02-28	WP-R1	Work continues to progress on WP-R1. We have completed work on our first project deliverable (Report on current state of knowledge regarding user needs for forecasts at different timescales in each sector). A paper based on this review has been submitted to Environmental Research Letters. Currently, we are in the process of running user-provider workshops in each partner country. These have been delayed from the previous schedule in order to ensure budget transfer, person availability and that workshops don’t clash with national election periods. However, the workshop in Ghana has been completed (8-9th Nov 2018) and a policy brief prepared to share with the wider SWIFT community and a general audience. Following on from the Accra workshop KNUST and GMet plan to run a similar event with users based in the north of Ghana (June 2019).  Workshops in Senegal (March 13th-14th 2019) and Nigeria (March 26th-27th 2019) are now scheduled with preparations ongoing. The workshop in Kenya is being planned to coincide with Testbed 1b (April/May 2019). Data gathered in these workshops will be combined with data from the reporting templates completed with each NMS, surveys conducted in each country in producing our second project deliverable (Rport on user perceptions and needs for forecast products for different timescales and sectors in each country).	Tasks R1.1.2 (Documentations of governance and institutional arrangements for NMSs), has been merged with the provider-user workshops. It was originally envisaged that this task could be accomplished using material gathered through NMS reporting templates (Task 1.1.3a-d) and interviews conducted at the SWIFT kick-off meetings, however it has become clear that more data is needed to do this. Rather than pursue this as a standalone activity, institutional arrangements will be explored through the provider user workshops, with user perceptions of these additionally being assessed through subsequent user surveys. Tasks R1.2.1 (Completion of standard protocols for user surveys and interviews) and subsequent piloting have been delayed. However, a survey with farmers and fishermen in Northern Ghana has been piloted by KNUST, and we are using this as a basis for developing a survey protocol that can be applied across context, with some country-specific and sector-specific modifications made	We have no deliverables scheduled for completion during the next quarter. However, we will complete Task R1.2.2a-d (Workshops bringing together NMS and user representatives in each partner country). 
2019-03-21	WP-R4	Good progress with developing a plan to give access to RDT products: RDT working in Leeds, being setup to work with a big dish for African data, plan to handover to African centres in 2019 summer school. Base-lining complete, with no centres actively using automated nowcasting. Some case studies in African centres.	Development of metrics delayed - will revisit at next WP3/Wp4 telecon	none
2019-03-21	WP-C1	Some successful activities have been achieved, including computational training in June 2018 (Ghana, with DARA), and joint training with SWFDP (Togo, Nov 18 and Nairobi, Jan 19). However, the strategic aspects of this WP are overdue and need attention. 	Communications in this WP have not been very effective. The meetings involve a large number of people, but the engagement can be quite passive, and we have not made progress on some important aims. In particular, we need to move quickly on the baseline activities in regard to skills, existing training, and gaps in provision: all these are overdue. We have some great opportunities to influence the training centres, which need to be taken. Note that there is an international initiative to develop integrated training for the BIP-M: we need the African SWIFT members to engage with this.	We need to defer the due dates for several tasks, but make sure they are done soon. This probably means sharing responsibilities more widely.
2019-03-21	WP-M2	A list of high impact weather (HIW) case studies of weather systems on national and bub-regional scales have been compiled and hosted on the wiki page of the Project.	No problems is envisaged for now	This list of case studies will be investigated across WPs for cross-work packages and holistic approach for the investigation will commence. 
2019-03-21	WP-C2	Testbed 1a successfully completed and some important lessons learned, operationally and scientifically. Plans are in good shape for 1b and 2.	No obvious concerns.	Testbed 1b.
2019-03-21	WP-R2	"The WP overall is on track. The data gathering exercises of D2.1, including understanding which data are available and suitable for forecast verification, are making good progress. All other deliverables depend on these tasks in D2.1 to be near completion before these can get fully underway, including the documentation. Apart from access to observations, the WP tasks also rely on forecast product availability for evaluation and therefore efficient communication with other WPs. Most tasks have persons associated with other WPs and the adoption of ""Slack"" is helping efficient communication."	"The monitoring and evaluation tasks associated with deliverable D2.7 need to be put into place now for this to work well across the SWIFT timeline. The reporting strategy for these tasks will be confirmed at the next telecon (14 March). Several tasks and deliverables have inappropriate ""planned completion"" dates. These are currently being reviewed on Slack."	No deliverables are due until November 2019 (D-R2.1)
2019-03-21	WP-R6	"This work package can broadly be divided into three categories: (i) improving our understanding of the drivers of sub-seasonal variability over Africa; (ii) Evaluation (including skill) of sub-seasonal prediction systems; (iii) S2S Forecast testbed and work is progressing in each of these. Much of this work is being developed within analysis of case studies which can cut across the WP.  i)	Drivers of sub-seasonal variability  Work has begun on analysing the role of the MJO on rainfall over West Africa and in particular its relationship to Monsoon Onset. Based on AEW tracking developed in WP5 we will also explore the sub-seasonal drivers of AEW variability. Work has begun more generally on Monsoon Onset in West African Partners. A more broad review of existing knowledge of sub-seasonal drivers is underway. ii)	Sub-seasonal forecast skill The S2S database has been used to assess forecast skill for weekly rainfall over the whole of Africa, including some preliminary assessment of skill conditioned on MJO phase; Monthly Rainfall over East Africa, including model biases; and Monsoon Onset for Nigeria, including assessment of the representation of the TEJ and AEJ. Papers are in preparation on each of these analysis. iii)	S2S Testbed: The testbed is planned to begin late in 2019 with the timing dependent on the access to realtime data, an application to S2S for realtime access to the archive has been made. The S2S project hopes to make realtime access available for 2 years in which case we will extend the testbed for a second year compared to the intial 1 year plan. Some work has begun on developing scripts to allow routine preparation of forecast products from the database. A key aspect of the testbed will be interaction with forecast users (a requirement for realtime access to the S2S database), and it is important that we start to develop these interactions well before we have realtime access to the archive.   We have performed a benchmarking survey of current operational practice and a document based on the analysis is in preparation."	We are still waiting to hear whether we will be granted realtime access to the S2S database. At the minimum we will have access to the NCEP data (publicly available) and we could extend to include SubX models. We are also having preliminary discussions with the Met Office about access to their data.	None due, although we expect to submit a number of papers contributing to D-R6.1 and D-R6.2 (and will form the basis on a benchmarking of forecast skill for D-R6.3) during the coming months as well as benchmarking for current operational practice for D-R6.5

In addition, TRMM thunderstorm and lightning data has been downloaded and this data analysis is about 40% complete	Manuscript from the temperature and humidity will be soon be submitted 	Upcoming deliverable is about 70% complete for KNUST 
2019-07-01	WP-R1	We have completed the user workshops in each partner country (T-R1.2.2a-d). Reports on the meetings in Ghana and Senegal have been completed and those for Nigeria and Kenya are in progress. These workshops have been well-attended and provided platforms to engage users from different sectors across different scales. A briefing note for the Ghana workshop has been produced, with briefings for the other countries to follow. An additional workshop in Northern Ghana is being planned for August 2019. While this workshop was not in our initial project schedule, it will provide a valuable addition to our work in Ghana. Information gathered during these workshops is being used to inform coordinated protocols for user surveys in each partner country, and we hope to use the general meeting in July in Ghana to agree on a process for coordinating these within the next few months. We are in the process of resubmitting an article based on our first deliverable to Environmental Research Letters.	Due to unavoidable challenges in coordinating in-country workshops (difficulties in appointing the WP-R1 facing ACMAD post, financial transfer delays, identifying feasible workshop times), which are being used to inform further work with users, we have been delayed on delivering Tasks T-R1.2.5a,b and T-R1.2.6a,b (interviews/surveys in partner countries), and a revised schedule is being developed. The interview protocols should be finalised during our meeting in July. As with other SWIFT WPs and activities, challenges in navigating financial arrangements have led to delays in areas of work and issues in maintaining engagement and morale amongst partners.	We have no deliverables due within the next quarter

The main analysis of those runs will be completed in 2020 and 2021. Update 26/06/19 CP ensemble forecasts were provided for Testbeds 1a and 1b and preliminary evaluation was performed on them during those events. We have developed a strategy for mixing time-lagged and true ensemble CP simulations to produce an optimal set of forecasts with good spread and lead times and within the constraints of the computing time available. We have a plan in place for which periods/dates to simulate (approx half severe weather case studies and half more average days). One test case has been completed, checked and analysed. Met Office will begin running the ensemble simulations in September 2019 and they should be completed by December 2019, in-line with the first deadline for that deliverable (D-R7.2). The evaluation of the CP ensembles and higher resolution deterministic simulations against the HyVic observations has commenced, this work will be completed by December 2019, with the rest of the evaluation and use of the runs taking place in 2020  and 2021.	D-R7.1 has been a little delayed, due to the late start of the WP-R7 PDRA. Beth Woodhams will start in April 2019 and will complete the literature review immediately. Update 26/06/19 D-R7.1 is under way and will be completed in September 2019. Late due to late start of WP-R7 PDRA.	No deliverables are due in the next quarter. Update 26/06/19 First deadline for D-R7.2 (delivery of ensemble runs) will be met in Dec 2019.
2019-12-09	WP-R7	Suitable dates for the bulk of CP ensemble simulations have been identified (T-R7.2.1). Some additional case studies may be added as they occur. Test cases have been run and an initial evaluation performed by Sam Clarke (T-R7.2.2). A final test case was recently completed and checked for complete requested diagnostics by Beth Woodhams. As a result, final model runs are underway (Stu Webster, T-R7.2.3, D-R7.2). Beth has been in contact with CEMAC who are helping to design a streamlined data download and file conversion from PP to netCDF (~1 month work).  For testbed 1b, some ensemble forecast products were produced (T-R7.2.4) but these will be added to and improved during the evaluation process and in anticipation of testbed 3. Carlo Cafaro has begun work on evaluation of CP ensembles vs. global ensembles (T-R7.3.1) as part of an ensembles introduction paper covering the testbed 1b period. Carlo and Beth have a meeting scheduled in December to talk further about the paper. Beth will likely be contributing a particular case study to the analysis.  The benchmarking report on current operational convection-permitting ensembles (D-R7.1 and T-R7.1.1) will be finalised by Beth by mid-December. D-R7.3 and D-R7.4 are on track but require model simulations to be completed.	It has been estimated that ~50 Tb of space will be needed to store the case study data on JASMIN (although this could be greatly reduced following conversion from raw PP to netCDF files. Given the storage space required by nowcasting (following discussions with Alex Roberts), we may need to consider increasing the size of the SWIFT workspace on JASMIN at some point.	D-R7.1 (Benchmark current state of knowledge and best practice in convection-permitting ensemble forecasting) A project report (2-3 pages) will be finalised by mid-December.

2019-12-09	WP-R1	In September a paper based on our first deliverable was accepted for publication in Environmental Research Letters. A policy brief on the Ghana (Accra) workshop has been produced and disseminated. The policy brief for the Senegal workshop has been completed and is in the process of being translated into French. The policy brief for Nigeria is in preparation. A paper reporting on our workshop activities related to exploring the potential for impact based warnings forecasts in West Africa is being prepared for submission to a special issue of Frontiers in Climate Risk Management (paper led by Elias Nkiaka).   Data collection for national surveys is currently in progress in partner countries (T-R1.2.5a to T T-R1.2.5d), with this being coordinated by Victor Savatia (ACMAD). Funding to support this activity has been disbursed to partner institutions in Kenya, Senegal and Nigeria. The disbursement to GMet is in the process of being resolved. Deliverable R1.2 “A report on user perceptions and needs for forecast products for different timescales and sectors in each country”, which will report on survey findings, along with the workshops, is scheduled for completion in Feb 2020.	Challenges within the last quarter have principally related to ensuring that funds for conducting national surveys are disbursed to NMS (and then pass through internal procedures within NMS). The process has run smoothly in Kenya, but delays were experienced in other countries. At the time of writing, disbursements for this task have been made to ANACIM and NiMet. At 	D-R1.2 “A report on user perceptions and needs for forecast products for different timescales and sectors in each country”
2019-12-16	WP-R2	The WP has seen a lot of change this year, aligning tasks and deliverables with people's ongoing activities. This has led to a greater involvement of forecast verification practice with the operational forecasting partners (GMet, ANACIM, KMD, and NiMet) and regular reports on forecast skill are now presented. The second major activity has been the selection and development of case studies during the science meeting in Kumasi, Ghana. Each case study has leadership assigned as of November and potential paper publications and collaborations are being developed. WP-R2 is very much a collaborative WP with other WPs and some publications planned are listed elsewhere. Nevertheless, papers are in preparation with planned submission for peer review in the next 3 months, particularly on evaluation of CP ensembles and nowcasting systems.	There is a risk of duplicating efforts across the WPs related to the case studies. This needs to be clarified across SWIFT, for instance by having a live record of publications/reports planned related to each case study, listing colleagues and institutes collaborating on each piece of work.	No deliverables are due in the next quarter. 
2019-12-16	WP-M2	A number of Legacy actions are in process. We have plans for the East African Handbook and updates to the West African Handbook. WPs are well engaged with this. We have a number of active partnerships and we are more thoroughly documenting ToRs for these, and tracking progress.   2) The Issue to access to peer review articles by scientists in the Global South is being worked on using GMet as a pilot. A report was submitted to the RMetS early December 2019; 3) Exploring synergy among SWIFT, MISVA and CREWS 	We lack reports from ACMAD, who currently have responsibility for coordinating a number of the Documentation actions. We need to be sure that ACMAD is confident to take leadership of these. 2) The response from RMetS regarding access to journal articles by scientists in the Global South is pending; 3) No further response beyond the initial response in completing the synergy template circulated 	"We need to ensure that the Partnerships planning and monitoring is completed, and that the responsibilities for Handbook chapters are assigned to the right groups. 2) To submit report to other publishers regarding access to journal articles by scientists in the ""Global South""; 3) To follow up on possible actions needed to establish the synergy"
2019-12-16	WP-C1	Progress has been good. We now need to develop a very clear programme of work to deliver the training tools demanded by partners. D-C1.1: The skills matrix has been completed by significant numbers of people: the data need to be analysed (Elijah: ACMAD). D-C1.2: The comparison of syllabuses and curriculum needs has been completed and is being written up for a paper (Elijah). Major conclusions are: Need for computational methods training, particularly python and R (and fortran), in universities and in weather services. Need for synoptic methods training, especially in universities. Includes development of case-study practicals. There is also a request for: NWP and modelling training: how to set up and run models, mainly in the weather centres. Nowcasting skills (both operational and universities). D-C1.3: Secondments call has been advertised.  D-C1.10: > 20 applications for the second call for fellowships (> 50% female).	No particular problems. We need to make decisions on training plans within the next quarter.	Develop strategy for delivering the training needed (D-C1.4/1.7) Use SWIFT meetings. We have budget for 2 science meetings and 1 more training event. Also partner budgets can be used for this (overheads, conferences and events budgets). Plan in-country collaborative events? E.g. UoN people will attend training at KMD.  Consider partnerships in training (e.g. EAMAC, WMO Global Campus (WMO-GC), SWFDP, EUMETSAT, …)  Select new set of fellows, and secondments. Analyse data from skills analysis. Plan Summer-School 2 (2021). 
2019-12-16	WP-C2	"Progress on the WP has been very good: We completed Testbed 1 and its washup in 2019, and the Kickoff for Testbed 2 (S2S) was completed in November 2019. A new initiative, to arrange ""demonstration exercises"" has been started, and 2 such exercises are planned, in Kenya and Ghana, with support from partners. Plenty of work is still needed to realise the outcomes of these activities, but we are making good progress."	(1) The report and paper on Testbed 1 are not yet completed - due at the end of the year (a near-complete draft was circulated in July 2019). (2) The report on the SAWIDRA-SWIFT operational forecasting event has been delayed and has not been circulated. Need to check progress on this with ACMAD. (3) The planning documents on the 2 demonstration exercises are needed.

2019-12-16	WP-M1	Fellowships cohort 2 is being recruited to - good news on number of applications and number of female applications. Cohort 1 fellows have provided mid-term reports, these are due to be evaluated by each fellows' management committee in January - outputs from these reviews will integrate findings and the work of the fellows into the SWIFT programme more fully and impacts communicated outside of the programme. Secondments are currently being advertised - call closes end Jan 2020. Annual reporting is in draft and AB meetings set-up to ensure AB & Project officer reporting is submitted on-time and with reflection on SWIFT activities. LY will pass on draft reporting documents to her maternity cover before leaving, so that this can be completed in the NY. Science Meeting 2019 and Summer School was a success. Report on this to be circulated to the EC before LY goes on maternity leave.	LY will be on maternity leave from mid-December 2019; her cover will begin in the role in january 2020 - short period of adjustment and other personnel changes in the PO are ongoing. Better alignment of the WPs in terms of science is needed - hopefully the case study development and working will facilitate this. 	Financial management plans and strategies needed from all partners; decision on Science Meeting 2020 (where and when); all meetings in calendars to end of 2021; case study development; refinement and prioritisation of project communications with the recruitment of a new Events and Comms Officer; LogFrame and ToC changes.
2020-01-10	WP-PB	Cross-project policy briefs	 	 
2020-02-24	WP-C2	"Testbed 1 report is complete and ready for review. 
Testbed 2 is underway and seems to be going well. We are agreeing methods of reporting and communication in Testbed 2, especially with the rest of the project and externally.
Testbed 3: very first steps and plans are being made."		"The planning documents on the 2 demonstration exercises are needed.
A plan for T-3 needs to be started."
2020-02-24	WP-M1	All cohort 1 fellows had their mid-term reports approved either without amendment or with minor amendments. Following the high number of applications received for the 2nd SWIFT fellowship programme, two fellows have been appointed at KNUST and UCAD and will launch their fellowships in April 2020. With the focus on women, we are delighted that both appointed fellows are female. The call for secondment applications closed and applications are currently under review (Elijah Adefisan leading). We had three useful and productive meetings with the SWIFT advisory board in February 2020. Various team members presented and now the advisory board will use those updates and discussions to compile their report for submission to the funder (deadline 31 March 2020). The project lead report has also been drafted and will be submitted by 31 March. Researchfish updates are being requested and uploaded to the portal for submission by 12 March 2020. The Science Meeting Organising Committee has confirmed the date of the meeting and associated workshops as 1-12 June. A venue is currently being secured in Somone, Senegal. Further details will be released soon and partners advised on financial claims. A new Events and Communications Officer has been recruited to work across both SWIFT and GCRF-AFRICAP. The new colleague will start on 30 March 2020. Helen Coskeran visited Dakar w/b 17 February and spent time with UCAD and ANACIM colleagues discussing project progress and management issues, it was a productive trip. The deliverable report and review process has run for the first time (with thanks to all who submitted) with most reports receiving no or minor amendments. The advisory board has suggested these be submitted to the funder with the annual reports. 	Feedback from some partners on financial processes (behind with claims and reconciliations; spending budget on different items; etc) that need to be addressed in liaison with FRO colleagues. Helen will work with partners that are at risk of underspend to finalise a spending plan before end of Q2 2020.	Financial management plans and strategies needed from partners at risk of underspend; further organisation of Science Meeting 2020; finalise data management strategy.
2020-02-24	WP-R4	(1) KMD has been using NWCSAF website, and UoN has used for training delivered in Rwanda . KNUST are generating & plotting NWCSAF products locally in near-real-time: this is a big step forward and we need to use the SWIFt2020 meeting, and virtual meetings, to spread this expertise. (1) Test-bed paper will be merged to a wider  SWIFT one, (2)  Nowcasting ooportunity paper with co-authors (3) paper draft of NWCSAF rain-rates evaluated against gridded products for retrieval & projections to 1.5 hours  drafted (4) Cross-SWIFT paper on NWCSAF for case studies has authors and cases assigned - importnat to make progress in run-up to annual SWIFT meeting (5) Evaluation vs best available rain gauges (e.g. DACCIWA gauges) still being planned(6) Longer storm track extrapolation still in infancy - need to keep staff time 'clear' for this (7) tools for automated downloading & plotting of NCEP data shared with SWIFT consortium (8) proposed regular zoon calls to use NWCSAF in near realk time with Kenya, Ghana/Nigeria then Senegal (following rain Nwards)	"(1)	African partners have not yet been using NWCSAF products much, if at all, in case studies, nor are case studies yet at a depth suitable for peer-reviewed publication. Paper planning progress is slow (although KNUST productive) (2)	NWCSAF not yet running in most African institutions – plan in place to address this through dedicated two days set aside for virtual side-by-side working (& a Slack channel). Recent progress in KNUST will help others set up their systems. (3)	Leeds PDRA research time has been limited due to NWCSAF logistics & other management. Must set aside some days/week for this.  (4)	Must finalise WP4 baseline document – in progress (5)	WP3 hiring needs to be finalised "	"D-R3.5	WP-R3	Phase 1. Case/statistical studies of evolution of storms using satellite products.should be delayed 9 months, Cases identified & NWC SAF generated restrospectively, but need time to analyses these.                   D-R3.8	WP-R3	Land-surface analysis	27	This work (characterising land persistence in response to rain from EO) won't start till April 2020 so should be dleayed 12 months"
2020-02-25	WP-R7	Simulations have all been run and Beth is working with CEMAC to download data efficiently (hopefully within next month). Carlo is continuing progress with paper and a case study has been decided for Beth to contribute. Beth/Carlo will likely have reciprocal visits to Reading/Leeds to work on paper in the next couple of months. D-R7.1 (Benchmark current state of knowledge and best practice in convection-permitting ensemble forecasting)  is complete and has been shared with all in WP. Other deliverables are on track.	It has been estimated that ~50 Tb of space will be needed to store the case study data on JASMIN (although this could be greatly reduced following conversion from raw PP to netCDF files. Given the storage space required by nowcasting (following discussions with Alex Roberts), we may need to consider increasing the size of the SWIFT workspace on JASMIN at some point. 25/2/20 Update: JASMIN space has been increased so this problem is reduced	
2020-02-26	WP-R6	Whilst there has been a lack of reporting to the database there has been progress made in each of the three main areas of the WP (i) drivers (ii) evaluation and (iii) testbed. Over the past 3 months much of the focus has been on developing the S2S testbed, including partners building relationships with their forecast users to develop co-production plans. These plans are at mixed stages in different operational centres. Most of the partners of the partners have been able to access the real-time data and use them to produce preliminary forecast products, and we've had positivie discussions with the last partner (ANACIM) who have had some changes of personal associated with the testbed. We've held (are holding) one-to-one meetings with each partner organization in the WP to ensure there is a clear plan of work for the rest of the SWIFT project and to ensure that there are activities addressing each of the deliverables. 	Some partners have not updated the reporting database, it's not clear whether these are issues at a partner lead level or a task lead level. Over the next months there is still a need to ensure that each person working on the WP has a clearly defined programme  of work, with tangilble outputs contributing to the WP deliverables.	None due, although we expect to submit a number of papers contributing to D-R6.1 and D-R6.2 (and will form the basis on a benchmarking of forecast skill for D-R6.3) during the coming months as well as benchmarking for current operational practice for D-R6.5
2020-02-28	WP-R1	"A paper reporting on key findings of the WP-R1 user workshops in West Africa is being prepared for submission to Frontiers in Climate Risk Management (lead author Elias Nkiaka). This paper will report on user-evaluations of products provided by NMHS, and the potential for development of impact based forecasting in Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal. Additional WP-R1 facing papers will be submitted to this special issue by David Awolala (SWIFT fellow) and Hellen Msemo (SWIFT affiliated PhD). 
Data collection for national surveys (TR1.2.5a-d) is wrapping-up in partner countries. Previously mentioned delays in these activities has meant that D-R1.2 “A report on user perceptions and needs for forecast products for different timescales and sectors in each country” has also been delayed. However, this report (which will be turned into a paper for submission to a peer review journal) will be a central topic of planning/discussion during meetings of the WP-R1 coordination team (Andrea Taylor, Philip Antwi-Agyei, Victor Savatia Indasi) in the first two weeks in March.  During this visit the coordination team will also focus on planning around a) continuing input into Testbed 2 (we will meet with the Testbed 2 and WP-R6 leaders); b) role in Testbed 3; and c) Deliverables D-R1.3 and D-R1.4. 
Parallel to the national surveys with key decision makers in climate sensitive sectors, KMD and the University of Nairobi have conducted a public survey (n > 300) to assess public perceptions of KMD. We are encouraging Kenyan partners to lead on a paper reporting on the findings of this work.
"	Telecommunication difficulties have hindered meetings between Leeds and ACMAD. As Victor Savatia Indasi is a key member of the work package coordination team, and has been leading on the national surveys, this had led to some challenges in work package planning. It is hoped that his visit at the start of March will help us to engage in further planning and strategy discussions. 	D-R1.2 “A report on user perceptions and needs for forecast products for different timescales and sectors in each country”
