2020-02-25	D-R1.2	Philip Antwi-Agyei	This deliverable is linked to an ongoing national surveys in the four SWIFT African countries. We had some delays in launching the surveys but we have made progress in the last few weeks and should be done with the surveys by end of February. The analysis will be then made when Victor - who has been coordinating this - visits the UK in early March. 	0		
2020-02-25	D-R2.1	Leonard Amekudzi	"We are unable to provide much information on this deliverable at the moment. This is as a result of:
1.	The unavailability of RADAR data. The RADAR used by Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet) has been out of operation for several years now. hence our inability to provide information on RADAR.
2.	KNUST just started receiving NWCSAF data. We are at the early stages of receiving and accessing the data and the variables available on the NWCSAF
However, data is available for high temporal (per min); DACCIWA rain gauges, rainfall data over parts of Ashanti Region from 2016 and GMet rainfall data from 1960.
We are glad to have started receiving NWCSAF and would be glad to report on the analysis that will be done using NWCSAF subsequently.
